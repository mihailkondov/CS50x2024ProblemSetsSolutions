If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

    The average listener likes dancable, relatively energetic songs (but not too energetic) with no particular preference for valence.
    I'd call the aura rythmic I guess?

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

    Taking averages will be very inacurate in the cases where a listener likes both very dancable, energetic or high-valence songs
    and at the same time likes non-dancable, low-energy and low-valence songs, but never songs where these parameters lie in the middle

    Looking at value distributions might give a better picture.
