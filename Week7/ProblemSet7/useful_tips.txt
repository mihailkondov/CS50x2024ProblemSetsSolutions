To test your queries in VS Code, you can query the database by running

$ cat filename.sql | sqlite3 movies.db

where filename.sql is the file containing your SQL query.



You can also run

$ cat filename.sql | sqlite3 movies.db > output.txt

to redirect the output of the query to a text file called output.txt. (This can be useful for checking how many rows are returned by your query!)

$ cat <- this can be used to read all kinds of files in the terminal
