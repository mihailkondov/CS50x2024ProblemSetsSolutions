# CS50x2024ProblemSetsSolutions
These are the solutions to the problem sets from cs50x 2024.\
The solutions pass all check50 tests.\
My final project is not included here yet.\
I enjoyed working on the finance project from week 9 very much, so I am creating another repository to keep developing that app.\

# Course description

Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.\
